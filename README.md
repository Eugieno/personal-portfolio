# personal-portfolio


## What problem was solved
As a bootcamp student, it is my intention to showcase all the projects I have done to the public and specifically to potential employers and clients.

## Why is this important
This is important as showcasing my work gives my audience a good insight into my skills/talent.  
It also affords me the benefit of organising my previous works for easy future references. 


## How was the problem solved
The problem was solved by creating a personal portfolio page that includes key information about myself together with a collection of my projects. 

The whole task was divided into 4 subtasks/issues based on essential features required of the webpage and coded sequentially. The 5 issues include; 
1. Coding the Navigation/header 
2. Coding the About me section
3. Coding the Portfolio section
4. Coding the Contacts/footer section

## Outcome
The following image shows the apparance of each section of the webpage after implementing all 4 issues.
